Abstract: Partition an array in three different regions (specific and general verions).

Partition an array in three different regions.
In the specific version, the array consists of only three types of elements: red, white, and blue. The algorithm sorts this array in linear time. The general version partitions an integer array in three regions based on a pivot element.
