Abstract: Consistency constraint between persons that can marry each other.
Description:
The marriage problem is about a class PERSON with a *marry* operation, and a class invariant that specifies the consistency constraint that marriage is symmetric. The difficulty lies in specifying the invariant and performing the *marry* and *divorce* operations.
